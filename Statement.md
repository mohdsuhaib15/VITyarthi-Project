Problem statement:
It can be really difficult to keep track of your daily calories, especially for anyone on a diet or with specific medical conditions. Current calorie trackers are complicated or online only, alienating certain users. What is needed, therefore, is a basic, offline-calorie tracker which permits users to quickly track and monitor the number of calories they consume on a daily basis.

Scope of the project:
This project aims to develop a lightweight command-line based Calorie Tracker application that calculates users’ daily calorie goals based on personal data using the Harris-Benedict formula. It allows easy logging of calorie intake either by numeric entries or food names, with persistent local storage ensuring offline use and data continuity. The tracker resets daily calories automatically with provision to expand for future enhancements like GUI, cloud sync, or AI-based features.

Target users:
• Fitness enthusiasts who wish to monitor their daily calories at a glance easily.
• Users who only have a limited or intermittent internet connection and would like to read the content offline.
• Novices who need a simple and easy calorie counter.
• Programmers and students who want to program health applications using Python.
• Health concerned people who wish to monitor their daily calorie intake with ease.
• Users with restrictions in their internet connectivity or who need to use the software offline.
• Rookies, who want to count their calories easy.
• Learners, students who are interested to know the Python made applications in health domain orNeed to develop (or) build Python based health teaching app for pedagogical purposes.

High-Level Features:
•	Personalized calorie goal calculation using weight, height, age, and gender.
	•	Persistent local storage of user profile, daily calorie intake, and custom food calorie database.
	•	Easy calorie logging via direct numeric input or named food entries.
	•	Automatic daily reset of calorie intake to represent accurate daily progress.
	•	Command-line interface with clear instructions and instant feedback on progress and goal status.
	•	Support for adding unknown foods dynamically by user input.
This statement highlights the motivation, boundaries, target audience, and critical features of the calorie tracker project in a clear, concise manner suitable for GitHub documentation.
